# Framworks

The "frameworks" feature in this compliance application is a comprehensive system for managing
  regulatory compliance standards. Here's how it works:

##  Core Concept

  Frameworks represent compliance standards like SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and NIST CSF.
   Organizations select which frameworks they need to comply with, and the system automatically
  generates the necessary compliance structure.

##  How It Works

  1. Template-Based Architecture

  - Pre-defined framework templates exist in the database with all requirements
  - When an organization adds a framework, it creates an instance of that template
  - This allows multiple organizations to use the same framework definitions

  2. Automatic Structure Generation

  When adding a framework to an organization:
  - Creates control instances from control templates
  - Generates policy instances from policy templates
  - Creates task instances from task templates
  - Maps controls to specific framework requirements

  3. Requirement Management

  Each framework has specific requirements (e.g., SOC 2's "CC1.2 Control Environment"):
  - Requirements are pre-defined in the framework template
  - Controls are mapped to requirements to show compliance
  - One control can satisfy multiple requirements across different frameworks

  4. Progress Tracking

  The system tracks:
  - Overall framework compliance percentage
  - Which requirements are satisfied by controls
  - Task completion status
  - Policy implementation status

  5. Multi-Framework Support

  Organizations can implement multiple frameworks simultaneously:
  - Shared controls can satisfy requirements across frameworks
  - Reduces duplication of compliance efforts
  - Provides unified view of compliance status

##  Key Benefits

  - Automation: Automatically generates compliance structure based on selected frameworks
  - Reusability: Controls and policies can satisfy multiple framework requirements
  - Scalability: Easy to add new frameworks without recreating entire compliance programs
  - Visibility: Clear tracking of compliance progress per framework

  The frameworks feature essentially acts as the backbone of the compliance system, defining what
  needs to be complied with and automatically structuring the organization's compliance program
  accordingly.

  # Translations

  ## I've successfully set up the translation system for the implementation page. Here's what was done:

  1. Created Translation Files

  - English translations: /apps/app/src/locales/features/implementation.ts
  - Spanish translations guide: /apps/app/src/locales/features/implementation-es.md

  2. Updated Main Translation Files

  - Updated both en.ts and es.ts to import the implementation translations

  3. Translation Structure

  The translations are organized with these keys:
  - implementation.title - "Implementation" / "Implementaci√≥n"
  - implementation.progress.* - Progress section translations
  - implementation.checklist.* - All checklist items translations
  - implementation.errors.* - Error messages

  4. Spanish Translations Provided

  All text has been translated to Spanish, including:
  - Welcome message: "Bienvenido a Comp AI"
  - Progress status: "{completedSteps} / {totalSteps} pasos completados"
  - All checklist items with proper Spanish translations

  5. Example Component Update

  I created an example file (OnboardingProgress-with-translations.tsx) showing how to update
  components to use translations:
  import { useI18n } from "@/locales/client";
  const t = useI18n();
  // Then use: t("implementation.progress.welcome")

  Next Steps

  Since the current system shares translation files between languages, you'll need to decide on the
  approach:

  1. Option 1: Create a language-specific structure for Spanish translations
  2. Option 2: Modify the existing implementation.ts to support multiple languages using a
  conditional approach

  The Spanish translations are ready in the markdown file and can be implemented using whichever
  approach fits your project's pattern.
