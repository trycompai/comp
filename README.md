## Stay Up-to-Date

Get access to the cloud hosted version of [Comp AI](https://trycomp.ai).

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Here is what you need to be able to run Comp AI without Docker.

- Node.js (Version: >=20.x)
- Bun (Version: >=1.1.36)
- Postgres (Version: >=15.x)

- Turbo (Optional):
```sh
   bun add -g turbo
```

### Local Development Setup

1. There are 3 main serices that have independent `.env` files, these need to be updated/maintained independently.

- Main Application:
```sh
   cp apps/app/.env.example apps/app/.env
```

- Employee Portal:
```sh
   cp apps/portal/.env.example apps/portal/.env
```

- Migrator/Seeder Service
```sh
   cp packages/db/.env.example packages/db/.env
```

2. Clone the repo:

```sh
   git clone https://github.com/trycompai/comp.git
```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
   cd comp
```

4. Install dependencies using Bun:

```sh
   bun install
```

5. Start the apps:

```sh
   bun run dev
```

Or use the Turbo repo script:

```sh
   turbo dev
```

---

### Docker Compose
This still requires you to bring your own Postgres DB, AWS S3 Bucket, Firecrawl API Key, OpenAPI compatible Endpoint, Resend API Key, Trigger Project + Key, and Upstash redis API Key. -- Work to move these into the compose still needs to be done, SeaweedFS should be looked at as an AWS replacment --

1. Clone the repo:

```sh
   git clone https://github.com/trycompai/comp.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
   cd comp
```

3. Copy the root example file and fill in the required values.

```sh
   cp .env.example .env
```

4. Set the required values (at minimum):
Variables that are uncommeented in `.env.example` are required, the commented out ones are optional and can be enabled as needed. 
Setting `FORCE_DATABASE_WIPE_AND_RESEED="true"` will wipe and reseed the local database the next time the containers start. And will continue to do it on every start until you flip it to `FORCE_DATABASE_WIPE_AND_RESEED="false"`.
Anytime you are using docker it is recomended that you set APP_ENVIRONMENT="local" there are other options but their implementation is experimental.

5. Bring the full stack up:

```sh
   docker compose up --build -d
```

6. SPECIAL NOTE: If you are getting stuck on resolving metadata provenance or the build hangs (more likely on MacOs) just restart the build, this is normal behavior related to your dns settings and/or a misconfigured envrionment variable which cannot connect to your service at build time. You can use Bake(docker-cacheing) to bypass the provenance hang.

```sh
   docker buildx bake --set *.provenance=false
   docker compose up --build --progress plain -d
```

To see why your are hanging you can run the following, which will do the docker build but maintain all logs, so you can audit the process.

```sh
   docker compose build --progress plain
```

The compose stack automatically runs database migrations and seeds if your database does not have them yet. 
Static images are served without Next.js image optimisation when `APP_ENVIRONMENT=local`, which resolves the server/client mismatch when requesting/serving images.

To force optimisation while still self-hosting, set `SELF_HOSTING=false` in `.env`; setting it to `true` (or leaving it empty while `APP_ENVIRONMENT=local`) keeps optimisation disabled so images/artwork load correctly. -- UnTested But Theoretically Correct-- 


## Cloud & Auth Configuration

### 1. Trigger.dev - Required

- Create an account on [https://cloud.trigger.dev](https://cloud.trigger.dev)
- Create a project and copy the Project ID
- Generate a Personal Access Token from **Account â†’ Tokens** (or [https://cloud.trigger.dev/account/tokens](https://cloud.trigger.dev/account/tokens)) and copy the value; this becomes your `TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
- In `comp/apps/app/.env`, set:
```sh
  TRIGGER_PROJECT_ID="proj_****az***ywb**ob*"
  TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN="tr_pat_***************"
```
- Optionally set `TRIGGER_QUEUE_CONCURRENCY` (defaults to 10) in `.env` to control how many Trigger.dev jobs run in parallel ie connect to your database.
- Expose your local app and portal to Trigger.dev with a public tunnel (e.g. ngrok). Trigger.dev will need to have a hopy of your env secrets so it can run. There you can place  NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_AUTH_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_PORTAL_URL with the public values. This way Trigger.dev can validate its actions are working. 
```sh
  brew install ngrok
  ngrok config add-authtoken <your-token>
  ngrok http 3000
  ngrok http 3002
```

### 2. PostgreSQL Requirements

- Enable the `pgcrypto` extension on your database (run `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pgcrypto";` once per cluster).
- Keep connection pooling in place for Trigger.dev (PgBouncer, Prisma Accelerate/Data Proxy, or managed pooling from your cloud provider) so application and Trigger.dev workloads stay within Postgres `max_connections`. Do not use PgBouncer on the App side, it will cause migrations to fail.

### 3. Google OAuth - Optional

- Go to [Google Cloud OAuth Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/clients)
- Create an OAuth client:
  - Type: Web Application
  - Name: `comp_app` # You can choose a different name if you prefer!
- Add these **Authorized Redirect URIs**:

```
  http://localhost
  http://localhost:3000
  http://localhost:3002
  http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
  http://localhost:3002/api/auth/callback/google
  http://localhost:3000/auth
  http://localhost:3002/auth
```

- After creating the app, copy the `GOOGLE_ID` and `GOOGLE_SECRET`
  - Add them to your `.env` files as `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID` and `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`

### 4. Redis (Upstash) - Required

- Go to [https://console.upstash.com](https://console.upstash.com)
- Create a Redis database
- Copy the **TOKEN** and **Redis URL**
- Add them to your `.env` files as `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`

---

### 5. Database Setup = Required-ish (NOT Required for Docker Compose setups)

Start and initialize your own PostgreSQL database. Add the PostgreSQL connection URI to the .env files as `DATABASE_URL` example: DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[username[:password]@]host[:port]/database[?options]"

1. Initialize schema and seed - Automatic if using Docker Compose additionally docker compose installations will automatically apply new migrations if there is any on every startup without harming your data.

```sh
   # Generate Prisma client (Build "Migrator" Templates)
   bun db:generate

   # Push the schema to your Postgres database
   bun db:push

   # CAUTION: Run only once! - Seed the database with initial data
   bun db:seed
```

Other useful database commands:

```sh
   # Open Prisma Studio to view/edit data
   bun db:studio

   # Run database migrations
   bun db:migrate
```

---

### Vercel

Steps to deploy Comp AI on Vercel are coming soon.

## ðŸ“¦ Package Publishing

This repository uses semantic-release to automatically publish packages to npm when merging to the `release` branch. The following packages are published:

- `@comp/db` - Database utilities with Prisma client
- `@comp/email` - Email templates and components
- `@comp/kv` - Key-value store utilities using Upstash Redis
- `@comp/ui` - UI component library with Tailwind CSS

### Setup

1. **NPM Token**: Add your npm token as `NPM_TOKEN` in GitHub repository secrets
2. **Release Branch**: Create and merge PRs into the `release` branch to trigger publishing
3. **Versioning**: Uses conventional commits for automatic version bumping

### Usage

```bash
   # Install a published package
   npm install @comp/ui

   # Use in your project
   import { Button } from '@comp/ui/button'
   import { client } from '@comp/kv'
```

### Development

```bash
   # Build all packages
   bun run build

   # Build specific package
   bun run -F @comp/ui build

   # Test packages locally
   bun run release:packages --dry-run
```
