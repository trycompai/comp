---

## Overview

The Aikido Security integration syncs vulnerability and repository scanning data into Comp AI, so compliance tasks can be automatically satisfied with continuous evidence.

## What Comp AI Collects

### Secure Code evidence

- Open security issues (by severity)
- Repository scanning activity
- Stale scans (repos not scanned in over 7 days)

### Monitoring and Alerting evidence

- Issue count thresholds (configurable)
- Severity breakdown summaries

## Configuration Options

After connecting, you can configure:

- **Minimum severity to fail on** (low, medium, high, critical)
- **Maximum allowed open issues** (threshold check)
- **Repositories to monitor** (optional filter)
- **Include snoozed issues** (optional)

## Verify It Works

1. Open the Aikido integration in Comp AI
2. Click **Run** on any check
3. You should see a recent run with passing or failing evidence

If a check fails with `HTTP 401: Unauthorized`, verify the Client ID and Client Secret and ensure the required permissions are enabled in Aikido.
