## Overview

The Aikido Security integration syncs vulnerability and repository scanning data into Comp AI, so compliance tasks can be automatically satisfied with continuous evidence.

## Setup

### 1. Create API credentials in Aikido

1. Go to **Aikido Settings → Integrations → API**  
   Or open: https://app.aikido.dev/settings/integrations/api/aikido/rest
![Aikido API page - Add Client button](/images/where_to_click_to_open_add_client_modal_in_aikido.png)
2. Click **Add Client**
![Create API client modal](/images/create_api_client_creredentiols.png)
3. Select **Private** as the app type
4. Select the following permissions:
   - `issues:read`
   - `repositories:read`
   - `basics:read`
5. Click **Create Credentials**

### 2. Connect in Comp AI

1. In Comp AI, go to **Settings → Integrations → Aikido**
2. Paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
![Enter Client ID and Client Secret in Comp AI](/images/setup_aikido_in_comp_ai_write_client_secret.png)
3. Click **Connect**
![Click connect for grant permissions](/images/click_to_connect_for_give_grant_permissions.png)
4. Authorize the app in Aikido when prompted

5. You will return to Comp AI and see the integration connected

Comp AI will exchange the credentials for an access token using OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials (server-to-server).

## What Comp AI Collects

### Secure Code evidence

- Open security issues (by severity)
- Repository scanning activity
- Stale scans (repos not scanned in over 7 days)

### Monitoring and Alerting evidence

- Issue count thresholds (configurable)
- Severity breakdown summaries

## Configuration Options

After connecting, you can configure:

- **Minimum severity to fail on** (low, medium, high, critical)
- **Maximum allowed open issues** (threshold check)
- **Repositories to monitor** (optional filter)
- **Include snoozed issues** (optional)

## Verify It Works

1. Open the Aikido integration in Comp AI
2. Click **Run** on any check
3. You should see a recent run with passing or failing evidence
![Example check run](/images/example_where_you_run_aikido.png)

If a check fails with `HTTP 401: Unauthorized`, verify the Client ID and Client Secret and ensure the permissions listed above are enabled in Aikido.
