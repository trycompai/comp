## Overview

Integrations let you connect third-party services (GitHub, AWS, Google Cloud, etc.) to automatically run compliance checks and collect evidence.

**Key Features:**
- Extensible architecture for adding new integrations
- Multiple auth strategies (OAuth, API keys, custom credentials)
- Automated compliance checks that map to tasks
- Background execution via Trigger.dev
- Type-safe with full TypeScript support

## How It Works

### 1. Integration Manifests

Each integration is defined by a **manifest** that describes:
- Authentication method (OAuth, API key, custom)
- Available compliance checks
- User-configurable variables
- API endpoints and headers

### 2. Checks

Checks are compliance validations that run against the external service. For example:
- GitHub: "Are all repos using branch protection?"
- AWS: "Are there any high-severity findings in Security Hub?"
- Google Workspace: "Do all users have 2FA enabled?"

### 3. Task Mapping

Checks can map to compliance task templates. When a check passes, the associated task is auto-completed.

Example: The GitHub "Branch Protection" check maps to the "Code Changes" task. When the check passes, the "Code Changes" task is automatically marked as done.

### 4. Connection Flow

**OAuth integrations:**
1. User clicks "Connect"
2. Redirected to provider's OAuth screen
3. User authorizes
4. Token stored securely (encrypted at rest)
5. Checks run automatically (if no variables needed) or after user configures variables

**Custom auth integrations:**
1. User clicks "Connect"
2. User enters credentials (API keys, service account, etc.)
3. Credentials stored securely (encrypted at rest)
4. Checks run automatically (if no variables needed) or after user configures variables

### 5. Auto-Run Logic

After connecting an integration:
- If all required variables are configured → Checks run automatically via Trigger.dev
- If variables needed → User configures them → Checks run
- Checks also run daily via scheduled Trigger.dev task

```

## Built-in Integrations

### Cloud Providers
- **AWS** - Security Hub findings
- **Azure** - Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- **GCP** - Security Command Center

### Identity & Access
- **Google Workspace** - User compliance, 2FA checks
- **Rippling** - Employee sync

### Developer Tools
- **GitHub** - Code security, branch protection, Dependabot
- **Vercel** - Deployment monitoring
- **Linear** - Team privacy, SSO checks
