### About Security Questionnaire

The Security Questionnaire feature allows you to automatically analyze and answer vendor security questionnaires using AI. Upload questionnaires from vendors, and our system will extract questions and generate answers based on your organization's published policies and documentation.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Automated Question Extraction**: Upload questionnaire files and let AI extract all questions automatically
- **Intelligent Answer Generation**: Answers are generated based on your published policies and organizational context
- **Manual Review & Editing**: Review and edit answers before exporting
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Leverage your organization's knowledge base for comprehensive answers

### Prerequisites

Before using the Security Questionnaire feature, ensure you have:

1. **Published Policies**: You must have at least one published policy in your organization
   - Navigate to **Policies** → **All Policies** to publish policies
   - Published policies are used as the source of truth for generating answers

<Note>
  If you don't have published policies, you'll see an onboarding screen prompting you to publish policies first.
