## Overview

Trust Access enables secure, controlled access to your compliance documentation for external users. This system manages the complete access lifecycle—from initial requests through NDA signing, access grants, and ongoing management—while maintaining full audit trails for compliance purposes.

This guide explains the Trust Access workflow from both administrative and end-user perspectives, ensuring clarity on what each party sees and experiences throughout the process.

## 1. Key Concepts

Trust Access consists of four core components:

- **Access Request:** An external user's initial request to access your compliance documentation.
- **NDA Agreement:** A legally binding document that must be digitally signed before access is granted.
- **Access Grant:** A time-limited authorization window (configurable, default 30 days) during which the user has access.
- **Access Link:** A secure, time-limited email link that authenticates the user and grants portal access.

### Time Limits and Expiration

Each component has specific time constraints:

| Item                 | Duration       | Notes                                                                    |
| :------------------- | :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NDA Signing Link** | **7 Days**     | Expires if not signed within 7 days. Administrators can resend the link. |
| **Access Grant**     | **7–365 Days** | Configurable access window. Default duration is 30 days.                 |
| **Access Link**      | **24 Hours**   | Email authentication links expire after 24 hours for security.           |

## 2. Prerequisites

Before using Trust Access, ensure the following is configured:

1. **Published Trust Portal:** The portal must be published and publicly accessible for users to submit access requests.

---

## 3. Workflow: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Access Request Submission

**What Users See:**
When external visitors access your public Trust Portal, they see a **Request Access** button. Clicking this button opens a form where they provide:

- **Personal Information:** Full name and email address
- **Professional Details:** Company name and job title
- **Purpose:** Reason for requesting access (required for audit purposes)

/>

<img
  src="/images/trust-access-request-form.png"
  alt="Access Request Form"
  style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem' }}
/>

**What Administrators See:**

- New access requests appear in the **Trust Access Management** dashboard
- Request status is marked as `Pending`
- Full request details including all submitted information are visible

**System Behavior:**

- If the user already has an active access grant, they see: _"You already have active access."_
- If a pending request exists, duplicate submissions are blocked with: _"You already have a pending request."_

### Step 2: Administrative Review and Decision

**What Administrators See:**
Access the **Trust Access Management** dashboard to view all pending access requests. Each request displays:

- Requester's name, email, company, and job title
- Purpose/reason for access
- Request submission timestamp
- Current status

<img
  src="/images/trust-access-admin-request-details.png"
  alt="Access Request Detail View"
  style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem' }}
/>

#### Option A: Approve Access Request

**Administrator Actions:**

1. **Review Request:** Click on the request to view complete details
2. **Set Access Duration:** Configure the access grant period:
   - **Custom Duration:** Specify a duration between 7-365 days
   - **Requested Duration:** Use the duration requested by the user (if provided)
   - **Default Duration:** 30 days if no duration is specified
3. **Approve:** Click **Approve & Send NDA** to proceed

<img
  src="/images/trust-access-admin-approve-duration.png"
  alt="Approve Access Request with Duration Configuration"
  style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem' }}
/>

**What Happens:**

- Request status changes to `Approved`
- A pending NDA agreement is generated
- An email is sent to the requester with an NDA signing link (valid for 7 days)
- An audit log entry is created: _"Access request approved for [Name] by [Administrator]"_

**What Users See:**

- They receive an email notification: _"NDA Signature Required"_
- The email contains a secure link to review and sign the NDA

<img
  src="/images/trust-access-email-nda-required.png"
  alt="NDA Signature Required Email"
  style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem' }}
/>

#### Option B: Deny Access Request

**Administrator Actions:**

1. **Enter Denial Reason:** Provide a reason for denial (required for audit compliance)
2. **Deny:** Click **Deny** to reject the request

<img
  src="/images/trust-access-admin-deny-dialog.png"
  alt="Deny Access Request Dialog"
  style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem' }}
/>

**What Happens:**

- Request status changes to `Denied`
- The denial reason and administrator name are logged in the audit trail
- No email notification is sent to the requester

**What Users See:**

- No notification is sent
- If they attempt to submit another request, they will see their previous request status

### Step 3: NDA Signing Process

**What Users See:**

1. **Email Notification:** They receive an email with subject _"NDA Signature Required"_ containing a secure signing link
2. **Review NDA:** Clicking the link opens a secure page displaying the complete NDA document
3. **Digital Signature:** They provide their digital signature to accept the agreement
4. **Confirmation:** After signing, they receive confirmation that the NDA has been completed

<img
  src="/images/trust-access-nda-signing-page.png"
  alt="NDA Signing Page"
  style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem' }}
/>

**What Administrators See:**

- NDA status updates to `Signed` in the dashboard
- Signed NDA PDF is available for download
- Access grant is automatically activated
- Audit log captures:
  - Signing timestamp
  - Signer's IP address
  - User Agent information
  - Final signed PDF document

<img
  src="/images/trust-access-admin-nda-signed.png"
  alt="Dashboard showing Signed NDA status"
  style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem' }}
/>

**System Processing:**

- IP address and User Agent are captured for legal non-repudiation
- A final, signed PDF is generated and stored securely
- The Access Grant is activated, enabling portal access

**Edge Cases:**

- **Expired Link:** If the 7-day signing window expires, administrators see `NDA Link Expired` status and can use **Resend NDA** to generate a new link
- **Already Signed:** If users attempt to access an already-signed NDA link, they are redirected to the portal

### Step 4: Portal Access Granted

**What Users See:**
After successfully signing the NDA, users receive an email notification: _"Access Granted"_. This email contains their first **Access Link** (valid for 24 hours).

Once authenticated via the access link, users can:

- **View Documents:** Browse and read all published, non-archived compliance policies
- **Download Bundle:** Generate a single PDF bundle containing all accessible policies
  - **Security Feature:** The downloaded PDF bundle is watermarked with:
    - User's full name
    - User's email address
    - Unique document identifier
    - This watermark enables traceability if the document is shared inappropriately

<img
  src="/images/trust-access-portal-view.png"
  alt="Trust Portal with Access Granted - Document View"
  style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem' }}
/>

**What Administrators See:**

- Access grant status shows as `Active` in the dashboard
- Grant expiration date is visible
- Download activity is logged when users generate PDF bundles
- All portal access is tracked in audit logs

---

## 4. Managing Active Access

### Reclaiming Access (Expired Access Links)

**What Users See:**
Access links expire after 24 hours. If a user attempts to use an expired link, they can reclaim access without administrator intervention:

1. Navigate to the Trust Portal
2. Click **Reclaim Access**
3. Enter their email address

<img
  src="/images/trust-access-reclaim-access.png"
  alt="Reclaim Access button and form"
  style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem' }}
/>

**System Behavior:**

- **Active Grant:** If their access grant is still within the valid period (e.g., day 5 of a 30-day grant), the system automatically sends a new 24-hour access link via email
- **Expired Grant:** If their access grant has expired, they see: _"No active access found"_ and must submit a new access request

**What Administrators See:**

- Reclaim attempts are logged in the audit trail
- No action required unless the grant has expired

### Revoking Access

**What Administrators See:**
Access can be revoked at any time through the **Grants** section of the dashboard. This is useful when:

- A partnership or contract ends
- An employee leaves an organization
- Access is no longer required

**Administrator Actions:**

1. Navigate to the **Grants** list in the dashboard
2. Locate the active grant for the user
3. Click **Revoke**
4. Enter a reason for revocation (required for audit compliance)

**What Happens:**

- Grant status immediately changes to `Revoked`
- The signed NDA is marked as `Void`
- All active access links are immediately invalidated
- The revocation action, reason, and administrator name are logged in the audit trail

**What Users See:**

- Any active access links stop working immediately
- If they attempt to reclaim access, they will see that their access has been revoked
- They must submit a new access request if access is needed again
