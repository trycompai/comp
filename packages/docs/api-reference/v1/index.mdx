# Comp AI API v1

Welcome to the Comp AI API v1 reference documentation. This section provides detailed information about our REST API endpoints, including request parameters, response formats, and example code.

## Authentication

Most API endpoints require authentication using an API key. You can manage your API keys in the [Settings \> API Keys](https://app.trycomp.ai/settings/api-keys) section of the dashboard.

API keys can be passed in one of two ways:

- In the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token: `Authorization: Bearer {api_key}`
- In the `X-API-Key` header: `X-API-Key: {api_key}`

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to:

```
https://app.trycomp.ai/api/v1
```

or, if you self-host:

```
https://app.yourdomain.com/v1/people
```

## Available Endpoints

The API provides access to the following resources:

- [Employees](/api-reference/v1/people) - Manage employees in your organization
- [Risks](/api-reference/v1/risks) - Manage risks and their mitigations

## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent JSON format:

```json
{
  "success": true | false,
  "data": {...} | null,       // Present on successful responses
  "error": "Error message",   // Present on error responses
  "details": {...}            // Optional detailed error information
}
```

## Error Codes

Common error codes you might encounter:

| 403         | Forbidden - Valid API key but insufficient permissions   |
| 404         | Not Found - The requested resource doesn't exist         |
