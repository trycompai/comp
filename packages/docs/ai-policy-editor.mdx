### Using the AI Assistant

The AI assistant responds to natural language requests. Simply describe what you want to change, and the assistant will propose a complete updated version of your policy.

**Example Prompts:**

| Request Type        | Example Prompt                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Add content         | "Add a data retention section that specifies 7-year retention for financial records" |
| Improve compliance  | "Make this policy more SOC 2 compliant"                                              |
| Simplify language   | "Simplify the language to be more readable"                                          |
| Add specifics       | "Add specific roles and responsibilities for incident response"                      |
| Framework alignment | "Update this to align with ISO 27001 Annex A controls"                               |

<Note>
  The AI always proposes complete policy content, not just fragments. This ensures formatting
  consistency and prevents accidental content loss.
</Note>

### Reviewing Proposed Changes

When the AI proposes changes, you'll see a status indicator showing the progress:

- **Drafting**: The AI is preparing the updated policy
- **Running**: The proposal is being processed
- **Completed**: Changes are ready for your review

Once completed, a diff viewer appears below the editor showing:

- **Red lines**: Content being removed
- **Green lines**: Content being added

#### Applying or Dismissing Changes

After reviewing the diff:

1. Click **Apply Changes** to accept the proposed edits
2. Click **Dismiss** to reject the changes and keep your current content

<Tip>Click "View proposed changes" in the chat to quickly scroll to the diff viewer.</Tip>

### Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: The more detail you provide in your request, the better the results. Instead of "improve this policy," try "add a section about password complexity requirements with 12-character minimum."

2. **Review Before Applying**: Always review the diff carefully before applying changes. The AI provides complete rewrites, so verify all sections are preserved as expected.

3. **Iterative Editing**: Make changes incrementally. Request one type of change at a time for easier review and better control over the final result.

4. **Ask Questions First**: If you're unsure what changes to make, ask the AI for suggestions. It can explain compliance requirements and recommend improvements before you commit to changes.

5. **Keep Policies Published**: Ensure your policies are published so other AI features (like Security Questionnaire) can reference the most current versions.

### Troubleshooting

**AI Assistant Not Appearing**

Ensure you're viewing the policy in **Editor View** mode, not PDF View. The AI assistant is only available in the editor.

**Changes Not Applying**

If changes fail to apply, check your network connection, ensure you have edit permissions for the policy, and try refreshing the page.

**Unexpected Content Changes**

If the AI modified sections you didn't intend to change, click **Dismiss** to reject the changes. Be more specific in your next request about which sections to modify, or reference sections by name.
