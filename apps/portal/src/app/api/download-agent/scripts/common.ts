  return `Installation Instructions for Windows:

1. First, run the setup script:
   - Right-click on "run_me_first.bat" and select "Run as administrator" (required)
   - This writes organization markers to the device and registry
   - If prompted by SmartScreen, click "More info" -> "Run anyway"

2. Then, install the agent:
   - Double-click "compai-device-agent.msi" and follow the wizard

3. Troubleshooting:
   - If setup fails, open the log at: %ProgramData%\\CompAI\\Fleet or %Public%\\CompAI\\Fleet -> setup.log
   - Ensure your antivirus or endpoint protection allows running local .bat files
   - If you cannot run as administrator, ask IT to assist or install both files and registry keys manually

4. After installation, the agent will start automatically.
